tag="$version"

# Building. This is required, unless your package only requires an install, in which case you can remove it. In this case, it is not required, so it is commented out.
#shoppebuild() {
#	getpkg # This automatically gets the package.
#	cd "$name"
#	# Building commands go here...
#	cd ../
#}

# Also, if you already get the package in shoppebuild, you don't have to redownload it in shoppeinstall.

# Installation. This is required.
shoppeinstall() {
	getpkg
	cd "$name"
	# Installation commands go here...
	sudo make install && success --noexit
}
