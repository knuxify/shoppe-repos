sourcetype="git-tag" # Source type, defines how to get the source.
# The source can be one of the following:
# git - git repository (clone with git) (optional: a commit variable)
# git-tag - github tag (clone with git) (requires tag variable, can also be used for getting certain branches)
# compressed - tarball (download with wget)
# You can also define a fallback source by prefixing the variables with "fallback", for example "fallbacksource" and "fallbacksourcetype".
tag="$version"

# Building. This is required, unless your package only requires an install, in which case you can remove it. In this case, it is not required, so it is commented out.
#shoppebuild() {
#	getpkg # This automatically gets the package.
#	cd "$name"
#	# Building commands go here...
#	cd ../
#}

# Also, if you already get the package in shoppebuild, you don't have to redownload it in shoppeinstall.

# Installation. This is required.
shoppeinstall() {
	getpkg
	cd "$name"
	# Installation commands go here...
	sudo make install && success --noexit
}
